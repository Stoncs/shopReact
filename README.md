# React js app

https://study-shop-react-application.herokuapp.com/  

This is my first app built with react. I made a site with a simple design to learn how to work with react. To understand this library.  

Products won't load because I made a website without a database. And the data was taken from the json file that was on the local server.

## Used technologies

Javasript  
React js  
Redux  
Scss
